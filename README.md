# test_assignment_g
One of my test assignment for a company interview

## SETUP

* Clone the project.
* install requirments.txt using `pip install -r requirments.txt` . Has some extra requirments for ipython and ipdb. But the basic requirment is `django`, `psycopg2` and  `Pillow`
* Expecting postgress is installed and correctly replaced the settings.
* I was thinking to add data migration or intial_data as a mgmt command, but right now out of time. I will try to add later.

Cheers...
