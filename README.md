# test_assignment_g
One of my test assignment for a company interview

## SETUP

* Clone the project.
* install requirments.txt using `pip install -r requirments.txt` . Has some extra requirments for ipython and ipdb. But the basic requirment is `django`, `psycopg2` and  `Pillow`
* Expecting postgress is installed and correctly replaced the settings.
* I was thinking to add data migration or intial_data as a mgmt command, but right now out of time. I will try to add later.

## Initial data which need to be add from admin end
* Create a superuser by `python manage.py createsuperuser`
* Login to admin end
* Create few categories first, atleast two.
* Create few Articles, Atleast 8 recomendded.

I will try to add mgmt command to add above object. In the mean time, let's go with initial entry.


Cheers...
